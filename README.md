### README for inf554-extractive-summarization-2023 Notebook

#### Overview
This README document is designed to guide users through the `inf554-extractive-summarization-2023.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. This notebook contains a series of machine learning models for extractive summarization, including several simpler models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and more complex ones like Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Each model is concatenated within the notebook for ease of comparison and analysis.

#### Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**
   - Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
   - The training and test folder in the same directory as the notebook. 

2. **Installation**
   - No additional installation is required if you have Jupyter Notebook and the necessary Python packages installed.

3. **Running the Notebook**
   - Open the `inf554-extractive-summarization-2023.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the cells sequentially.
   - The notebook is structured in a way that each model is contained in separate, clearly marked sections.

#### Notebook Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: This section includes all the preprocessing steps necessary for the models to function correctly.
- **Model Implementation**: Each model, from KNN to DNN, is implemented in its own subsection. This includes model initialization, training, and evaluation.
- **Results and Evaluation**: The results, including the F1-scores for each model, are displayed after the corresponding model sections.
